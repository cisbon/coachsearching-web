# Guidance: Hero Video Layout for Coach Profile
**Created:** 2025-12-10 00:01

## Goal
Implement two-version detail profile: video as hero (if available) or current layout (if no video).

## Tasks
- [x] Read CoachProfilePage.js hero section structure
- [x] Modify hero to conditionally render video player or profile image
- [x] Reuse existing CoachVideoPlayer component
- [x] Add CSS for hero video layout
- [x] Increment version to v1.9.0
- [x] Test both layouts
- [x] Commit and push (c056b52)

## Files to Modify
- `/js/pages/CoachProfilePage.js` - Hero section conditional rendering
- `/css/coach-profile-page.css` - Hero video styles
- `/js/app.js` - Version bump

## Strategy
- Use ternary/conditional in JSX: `coach.video_intro_url ? <VideoHero /> : <ImageHero />`
- Extract shared elements (name, rating, buttons) to avoid duplication
- Video hero uses CoachVideoPlayer component from coachProfile.js
