# Guidance: Fix Video Display Issues
**Created:** 2025-12-09 19:35

## Goal
Fix video visibility in coach cards and make profile video clickable.

## Problems
1. Coach card videos: iframe has `height: 100%` but parent uses `aspect-ratio` - height calc breaks
2. Profile play button: `opacity: 0` by default - users don't see click target

## Tasks
- [x] Add absolute positioning for `.youtube-iframe` and `.video-element` when playing
- [x] Make profile play button always visible (not just on hover)
- [x] Increment version to v1.8.2
- [ ] Test both fixes

## Files to Modify
- `/css/coach-profile.css` - Fix iframe/video positioning
- `/css/coach-profile-page.css` - Make play button visible
- `/js/app.js` - Bump version
