        "pricing.faq.coachNotesA": "Coach Notes is a simple client management tool. When someone books a discovery call with you, they're added to your client list. You can then keep private notes about each client – what you discussed, their goals, progress, and anything else you want to remember. Only you can see these notes.",

        "pricing.faq.cancelNotesA": "Your profile stays active on the Free plan. You keep read-only access to your existing Coach Notes, but cannot add or edit notes. Your discovery call slots reduce to 1 per week, and your profile reverts to Free tier limits.",

        "pricing.faq.discoverySlotQ": "Was zählt als \"Kennenlern-Termin\"?",
        "pricing.faq.discoverySlotA": "Ein Kennenlern-Termin ist ein verfügbares Zeitfenster, in dem potenzielle Kunden ein kostenloses Einführungsgespräch mit Ihnen buchen können. Im kostenlosen Tarif können Sie 1 Termin pro Woche anbieten. Premium-Coaches können unbegrenzt Termine anbieten.",

        "pricing.faq.coachNotesA": "Coach Notes ist ein einfaches Kundenmanagement-Tool. Wenn jemand ein Kennenlern-Gespräch bei Ihnen bucht, wird er zu Ihrer Kundenliste hinzugefügt. Sie können dann private Notizen zu jedem Kunden führen – was Sie besprochen haben, ihre Ziele, Fortschritte und alles andere, woran Sie sich erinnern möchten. Nur Sie können diese Notizen sehen.",
        "pricing.faq.prioritySearchQ": "Was bedeutet \"Bevorzugte Such-Platzierung\"?",
        "pricing.faq.prioritySearchA": "Premium-Coaches erscheinen höher in den Suchergebnissen, wenn potenzielle Kunden nach einem Coach suchen. Sie erhalten außerdem ein \"Empfohlener Coach\" Badge, das Ihr Profil hervorhebt.",
        "pricing.faq.cancelNotesQ": "Was passiert mit meinen Coach Notes, wenn ich Premium kündige?",
        "pricing.faq.cancelNotesA": "Ihr Profil bleibt im kostenlosen Tarif aktiv. Sie behalten Lesezugriff auf Ihre bestehenden Coach Notes, können aber keine Notizen hinzufügen oder bearbeiten. Ihre Kennenlern-Termine werden auf 1 pro Woche reduziert, und Ihr Profil kehrt zu den Limits des kostenlosen Tarifs zurück.",
        "pricing.faq.upgradeDowngradeQ": "Kann ich jederzeit upgraden oder downgraden?",
